# Techno-Fundamental Stock Analysis Suite

A professional-grade stock analysis application that bridges the gap between **Technical Analysis** and **Market Logic**. This tool automates the "Top-Down" routine used by professional traders to ensure every trade is supported by broad market tides and sector leadership.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Unified Technical Dashboard
- **Single-Canvas Architecture**: Price, Volume SMA, and RSI are perfectly synchronized on a single time-axis.
- **Stacked Scale Layout**: Professional multi-pane view optimized for precision entry/exit timing.

### 2. Market Intelligence Dashboard (The "Brain")
The **Intelligence Tab** is the core of the application, transforming raw data into actionable "Market Logic."

#### A. Automated Market Regime Detection
The system automatically classifies the stock into one of the four market phases:
*   **Accumulation**: Sideways consolidation; Smart money absorption.
*   **Mark-Up**: Trending uptrend; Public participation.
*   **Distribution**: Choppy sideways; Smart money offloading.
*   **Mark-Down**: Trending downtrend; Panic selling.
*   **Reliability Score**: Every signal is scored (High/Medium/Low) based on the confluence of **Trend** (EMAs), **Volatility** (ATR), and **Flow** (Volume/RSI).

#### B. Automated Top-Down Routine
An automated checklist verifying the 4 pillars of a high-probability trade:
1.  **Macro**: Checks if the S&P 500 (SPY) is trending positive ("Risk-On").
2.  **Sector**: Scans all 11 GICS Sector ETFs to ensure your stock is in the #1 leading market sector.
3.  **Chart**: Verifies the stock is in a "Mark-Up" regime.
4.  **Execution**: Checks for high-confluence technical triggers.

#### C. Macro Tides & Strategic Playbook
Automated tracking of the "Why" behind market moves:
- **Growth (XLI)**: Monitored via Industrials performance.
- **Inflation (TIP)**: Monitored via inflation-protected bond trends.
- **Liquidity (^TNX)**: Monitored via 10-Year Treasury Yields.
- **Strategic Playbook**: Synthesizes these tides into a specific recommendation (e.g., "Goldilocks Zone: Aggressively target High-Beta Tech").

## 📈 How to Use the Intelligence Tab

The Intelligence tab should be used to filter your technical setups. **Never trade a technical breakout if the Market Intelligence is "Risk-Off" or in a "Distribution" regime.**

### The Workflow:
1.  **Select a Stock**: Start in the Technical tab to find a setup.
2.  **Check the Tide**: Switch to the **Intelligence** tab. 
    - Is the **Macro Tide** expanding?
    - Is the **Strategic Playbook** suggesting your stock's sector?
3.  **Verify the Routine**: Look at the **Automated Routine** box. 
    - All boxes green? -> **High-Probability Trade.**
    - Sector or Macro red? -> **High-Risk Trade (Consider skipping).**
4.  **Observe Reliability**: Only size up if the **Reliability Badge** is "High."

## 💡 Examples & Scenarios

### Example 1: The "Goldilocks" Breakout
*   **Technical Tab**: AAPL is breaking out of a 3-month range.
*   **Intelligence Tab**: 
    - **Regime**: Mark-Up (High Confidence).
    - **Macro**: Risk-On (SPY > EMA 50).
    - **Sector**: Technology is the leading sector.
    - **Playbook**: "Goldilocks Zone: Target Tech."
*   **Decision**: **Strong Buy.** All cylinders are firing.

### Example 2: The "Bull Trap" (Stagflation)
*   **Technical Tab**: TSLA shows an RSI oversold bounce. Looks like a "buy the dip" opportunity.
*   **Intelligence Tab**:
    - **Regime**: Distribution (Medium Confidence).
    - **Macro**: Risk-Off.
    - **Inflation**: Rising Pressure.
    - **Sector**: Energy is leading; Technology is lagging.
*   **Decision**: **Avoid / Short.** The technical bounce is fighting the macro tide and a distribution regime.
